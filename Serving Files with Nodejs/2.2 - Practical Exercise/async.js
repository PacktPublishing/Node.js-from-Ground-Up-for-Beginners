/*
 * Write your asynchronous file serving web app here!
 *
 * Hint: Try combining our simple web server from chapter 1 with
 * fs.readFile()
 *
 * Hint 2: DON'T use utf8 as a parameter to readFile() as I did in the video. That's only needed if
 * we're sending regular text, but here we're sending HTML instead. You can simply ignore that parameter
 * and just give the file name and a callback function only.
 *
 * If you get stuck see a working example under solutions/async.js
