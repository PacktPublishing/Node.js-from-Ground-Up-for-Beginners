WATCH VIDEO 2.2 FIRST

In this exercise you should create two servers that serve
index.html (provided in this folder). One should do so
asynchronously, and the other should do so synchronously.

I have already created a Node.js package for you so there 
is no need to do so. If you get stuck the 'solutions' folder
contains a possible solution for the synchronous and 
asynchronous versions of the server.

You should add in console.log statements wherever you feel 
necessary to make sure you understand how asynchronous functions 
work, as this will be very important to understanding the rest
of the course. If you are still confused, try re-watching the 
video.

Good Luck!
